Abstract type that describes a Newton Polygon/Hodge Polygon

There are a couple of ways to store such data, the idea
is that different implementations can be used to implement
those different strategies

Represents a polygon that starts at
(0,0) and contines for slope slopes[i]
for slopelengths[i] units.

For example, SlopesPolygon([1,19,1])
is the hodge polygon of
(the primitive second cohomology of)
a K3 surface.

This is implemented in an "eager" way, i.e.
all relevant constructions are calculated
upon creation of the struct.

`slopes` - a list of slopes of the polygon
`slopelengths` - a list of how long each slope goes for
`values` - the value of the polygon as a function, evaluated starting at x=0
`slopesbefore` - given an x, what is the slope in the coordinate just before x,
                 by definition slopesbefore[1] = 0
